		<h1>John Smith</h1>
		
		<p>Hello. My name is John Smith and I'm a student at Full Sail University that is majoring in Web Design and Development. I'm currently enrolled in the Web Standards Project course, which is being taught by Professor Josh Bloom. What you see here is the product of my first assignment in this course: Building a Library. Here is where I'll keep portfolio of my components and other things during the course of this class.</p>
